<p> <p>“Entrepreneurship is the act of being an entrepreneur, which can be defined as “one who undertakes innovations, finance and business acumen in an effort to transform innovations into Economic goods.”</p><br>
<p>Entrepreneurship can create new organizations or develop a strategy to revitalize mature
organizations in response to a perceived opportunity.The most obvious form of entrepreneurship is that of starting a new business also called As“startup Company”. More recently, the term has evolved to include other types of
entrepreneurship such as:</p><br>
 
<b>• Social entrepreneurship</b> that applies the “entrepreneurial principles to organize,
create and manage a venture to achieve social change” and<br>
<b>• Political entrepreneurship</b>,br> or “starting a new political project, group, or political
party.”<br>
No society can exist without entrepreneurship. Every society depends on entrepreneurs.<br>
<h2><b>Definition of 'Entrepreneur'</b></h2><br>
<p>An individual who, rather than working as an employee, runs a small business and assumes all
the risk and reward of a given business venture, idea, or good or service offered for sale. The
entrepreneur is commonly seen as a business leader and innovator of new ideas and business
processes. </p><br>
<h2><font color:”blue”><b>Who is an entrepreneur? What characteristics define an entrepreneur?</h2></font></b><br>
<h3><b><i>Dan Sullivan Says that:</b></i></h3><br>
“An entrepreneur is someone who does not expect compensation until he has created value for someone else.”
<h3><b><font style="color:blue">Jean-Baptist Say, Says that:</b></font></h3><br>
<p>“Entrepreneur is someone who takes resources from a lower level of productivity and raise them
to a higher level.”</p>
<h2><font style="color:green"><b>ELEMENTS OF ENTREPRENEURS</font></b></h2><br>
 
<p>To sum up in the light of the developments, there are four key elements of entrepreneurs. </p><br>These are:<br>
• <b>Vision</b> (identifying emerging opportunities)<br>
• <b>Innovation</b> (creating new business or new ways of doing something)<br>
• <b>Risk bearing</b> (taking risk and facing uncertainty)<br>
• <b>Organizing </b>(collection and coordination of the necessary resources)<br>
 
<h2><font style="color:green">CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ENTREPRENEUR:</font></h2><br>
The characteristics of entrepreneurs are numerous? a successful entrepreneur possesses a<br>
Combination of traits that show both innovation and leadership qualities. Scholars from around<br>
the world have worked tirelessly to discover just what characteristics make a good entrepreneur;<br>
what exactly makes up a business founder's x-factor? While a lot of the findings are still pretty
much open to debate, there's no questioning that great entrepreneurs have the following traits:<br>
<h4><b><font style="color:red">Ambition</font></b></h4><br>
A good entrepreneur is driven to make something of himself. He knows what he wants,
and he sets a course to get it. His motivation to achieve something can sometimes be<br>
overwhelming, and the urge to establish himself can be quite consuming. An entrepreneur's
ambition is often the key ingredient that gets him off of his chair and puts him into action,<br>
turning his daydreams into reality.<br>
<h4><B><font style="color:red">Enthusiasm</font></b></h4><br>
Often coming hand-in-hand with ambition, enthusiasm plays a great role in the<br>
entrepreneur's motivation. While ambition may be the key to the entrepreneur's ignition, <br>
Enthusiasm is the gas. Every successful entrepreneur has a positive outlook giving him the<br>
energy to pursue his endeavors. Without enthusiasm, an entrepreneurial project will slowly<br>
wither into inactivity and failure.
 
<h4><b><font style="color:red">Creativity</font></b></h4><br>
When problems do arise, you can count on creativity to bail you out. Creativity is<br>
probably what led you to envision your company in the first place, and it'll be creativity that will<br>
help you realize the possible solutions to any hitches that might come your way. Successful<br>
entrepreneurs find inspiration throughout the entire process, and often discover ways to turn<br>
Roadblocks into opportunities<br>.
<h4><b><font style="color:red">Decision-making</font></b></h4><br>
Entrepreneurs call all the necessary shots. While their creativity makes them men of<br>
ideas, it's their ability to make decisions that will make them men of action. The decisions that<br>
entrepreneurs make will determine the fate of the company, and it's only through decisionmaking <br>that things will actually happen. An entrepreneur with poor decision-making skills will<br>
have his company caught in a state of inactivity and degradation; good decision-making skills, <br>
on the other hand, will ensure that the best possible measures in putting up the business will be
enforced. <br>
<h4><b><font style="color:red">Perseverance</font></b></h4><br>
Perhaps the most important of all the characteristics of entrepreneurs is the ability to<br>
withstand the troubles that come with starting a business. Beginning a new enterprise is an <br>
immensely difficult task, and as an entrepreneur, you'll have to stick through the storms and<br>
stress if you want your venture to be a success. It sometimes takes years for a good idea to start
making you money, but when it does, you'll be glad you stood strong in the face of adversity. <br>
<h2><b><font style="color:blue">ENTREPRENEURIAL TRAITS</font></b></h2><br>
<h4><font style="color:green">1. Passionate</font></h4><br>
Strong and barely controllable emotion<br>
You need to be driven by a clear sense of purpose and passion. Typically, that passion comes<br>
from one of two sources: the topic of the business, or the game of business-building itself. <br>
Why do you need passion? Simply because you’re likely to be working too hard, for too long,for<br>
too little pay with no guarantee that it’ll work out… so you need to be motivated by something<br>
intrinsic and not money-related. <br>
<h4><font style="color:green">2. Resilient</font></h4><br>
If you’re going to build a startup, you’ll need a spirit of determination coupled with a<br>
high pain tolerance. You’ll need to be willing and able to learn from your mistakes – to get<br>
knocked down repeatedly, get up, dust yourself off, and move forward with renewed motivation. <br>
People will constantly tell you your baby’s ugly, that your business won’t work. Now, <br>
you should listen carefully and be open to constructive criticism. But after a while, having the<br>
door slammed in your face repeatedly can be withering, and the best entrepreneurs learn to feed<br>
off the negativity and actually gain strength from it. <br>
<h4><font style="color:green">3. Self-Possessed</font></h4><br>
You need a strong sense of self. You can’t be threatened by being surrounded by talented, <br>
driven people. To truly succeed, you’ll need the self-confidence to surround yourself with people<br>
“who don’t look like you”… that is, people with skills, background and domain knowledge that<br>
complement your own. And check your ego at the door: you shouldn’t be too proud to make
coffee for the team, empty the waste baskets, or do the bank runs. <br>
<h4><font style="color:green">4. Decisive</font></h4><br>
You’ll need to develop a comfort-level with uncertainly and ambiguity. Entrepreneurs<br>
gather as much information as they can in a short period of time, and then MOVE, MOVE, <br>
 
MOVE!! The attitude is that it’s not going to be perfect… We only have 9% or so of the data<br>
 
from which to base our decision… but if we wait to have all the information, we’ll never get<br>
 
moving… and be mired in indecision. (Big organizations are really good at this – the mired thing<br>
 
– saying, We don’t have enough information, so let’s continue to study… form a committee or a task force) <br>
 
. <b>5. Fearless</b><br>
 
On the sliding scale from “risk-averse” to “risk-seeking,” it shouldn't surprise<br>
 
anyone that entrepreneurs tend to be closer to the latter. But you don’t need to be a nut-<br>
 
case, the sort who bungee-jumps without a helmet. Smart entrepreneurs develop an<br>
 
intuitive ability to sniff out and mitigate startup business risk. But you know you’re going<br>
 
to fall down, and feel comfortable with that fact and that you’re going to learn from your<br>
 
failures and adjust as you go. <br>
 
. <b>6. Financially Prepared</b><br>
 
You’ll need the right personal financial profile to make the leap. This doesn’t mean that<br>
 
only the rich can be entrepreneurs. But unless and until you’ve got the personal financial<br>
 
‘runway’ (ability to go without a steady paycheck and subsidized benefits) of at least 18 to 24<br>
 
months (ideally longer), you might hold off on quitting your day job. <br>
 
Consider launching the startup as a side-business if that’s possible, while continuing to<br>
 
work the 8-to-5 shift to cover the bills. Or approach your boss about going part-time. Then, once<br>
 
your business generating cash flow, you can dial back on your hours, or submit your resignation
and go full-time with your startup. <br>
 
 
 
. <b>7. Flexible</b><br>
 
I challenge you to find an entrepreneur running a startup four or more years old where<br>
 
that business doesn’t differ dramatically from the vision sketched out in their original business<br>
 
plan. The point is that the folks who stay on their feet are the ones who stay flexible and adjust to<br>
 
new information and changing circumstances. <br>
 
. <b>8. Zoom Lens-Equipped</b><br>
 
You may not start out with a fool-proof gyroscope, but to survive as an entrepreneur, <br>
 
you’ll need that strong sense of perspective. How to maintain simple, clear focus. How to be at<br>
 
peace with, and learn from, a failure. Understanding that not all battles are worth winning, and<br>
 
when to walk away. Knowing that most in your startup aren’t as entrepreneurial as you – that this<br>
 
may be a very cool job for them, but it’s still a job. Knowing when to go home and give your<br>
 
loved ones a hug. When to go for a run. <br>
 
Can you ‘pan out’ to see a compelling big vision for your business, then ‘zoom in’ and<br>
 
focus on near-term startup goals? Successful entrepreneurs can facilely move back and forth<br>
 between these two views. They’re able to articulate the big picture, while simultaneously<br>
 
Managing and executing to the ‘zoom-in’ picture. <br>
 
. <b>9. Able to Sell</b><br>
 
Whether you’re a born extrovert or introvert, as a founder/CEO, you’ll find yourself
always selling. You’ll be selling your vision to prospective partners and funding sources. You’ll
be selling prospective recruits on why they should quit their day jobs and join this startup they’ve<br>
 
never heard of. You’ll be selling your products and services (yes, you’ll probably be personally
closing at least the first few sales). You’ll be selling your employees on why they should remain
calm and stay with the ship when the seas inevitably get rough. <br>
 
 
 
. <b>10. Balanced</b><br>
 
You may not start out with a fool-proof gyroscope, but to survive as an entrepreneur,
you’ll need that strong sense of perspective. How to maintain simple, clear focus. How to be at
peace with, and learn from, a failure. Understanding that not all battles are worth winning, and<br>
 
when to walk away. Knowing that most in your startup aren’t as entrepreneurial as you – that this
may be a very cool job for them, but it’s still a job. Knowing when to go home and give your
loved ones a hug. When to go for a run. <br>
 
<h2><b>GOAL-SETTING STRATEGIES</h2></b><br>
 
Goal setting is directly related with entrepreneurship. To get success, proper goal setting in personal and professional level is important. An entrepreneur does this by following proper <br>
strategy and implementation and not just by listing down what he wants to do. It demands an emotional and intellectual balance to be achieved successfully. <br>
 
<b><font style="color:green">Listening to Your Emotions</font></b>><br>
 
It is very important to understand the emotional aspect of goal setting to achieve it. Emotions make a person who they are. Emotions affect a person’s health and work as well. Personal vision is important to achieve what you aim for. This can be done by the following ways -<br>
 
 
• <b>Vision </b> A clear vision helps people have a goal and connect them with their convictions and emotions. <br>
 
 
• <b>Recognize your values </b> - Values show what you have learnt and those lessons will shape your future. <br>
 
 
• <b>Consider your goals </b> - Understand your goals and how you wish to achieve it. <br>
 
 
• <b>Write it down </b> - Note down your vision statement and visit it occasionally to check if some changes are to be made. <br>
 
 
These simple habits can change the way you want to write your destiny and achieve what your goals are. It is important to understand your emotions and have a clear idea about them before explaining others what you actually want to others to see. <br>
 
<b><font style="color:green">Prioritizing Goals based on Re-Gating</b></font><br>
 
Sensory Gating is a process that the brain uses to adjust to stimuli. Our brain has a direct connection to filter out distracting stimuli and performance. Negative emotions like stress, anxiety and depression can switch the chemistry of the brain and limit the effectiveness of sensory gating. <br><br>
 
 
It is very important to set priorities. All your goals should be prioritized, so that you can focus on them accordingly. You should learn to maintain a proper balance in your life through personal values, visions and professional goals. <br>
 
So, to prevent this imbalance, Re-Gating is important. This can be done by using some relaxing techniques like meditation which calms the mind and body and filter out distractions. It is better to try some relaxation techniques before goal setting to have a clear mind, so that it becomes easier to fulfill certain goals and objectives. <br>
 
 
<b><font style="color:green">SMART Goals</b></font><br>
 
Goals and objectives motivate people and help them to work in the right direction. This helps them to focus on short term goals by giving them enough time to achieve =them. In other words, the strategy for your goals should be<b> SMART</b>-, which when elaborated in this context means -<br>
 
 
• <b>Specific</b> - The first thing is to be sure about your goals. Like imagining your goal for 10 minutes every day.
<br>
 
• <b>Measurable </b>- - Set a time by which you should probably reach your goal. Like becoming more productive and increasing some percent of productivity is not specific<br>
• <b>Attainable </b>- - Make goals that you can achieve within the given timeframe. For example, if you are thinking of doubling your salary within a month, it is not possible. <br>
 
• <b>Relevant</b> - The goals you aim should be like your situation. For example, a goal to increase production is not relevant for a person in sales. <br> 
• <b>Timely </b>- Your goals should have a timeframe. <br>
 
 
<b>SMART</b>-  is the best strategy one can plan to achieve goals and focus on the right direction. It is better to have short goals and work on them rather than having long term goals which cannot be attained in the upcoming future. <br>
 
<h2><b>HOW TO BE A TRUE ENTREPRENEUR</b></h2><br>
 
 
A careful decision must be made to move on to a position involving leadership. This means that, entrepreneurs should begin to inherit attributes of great leaders from now onwards. This can boost entrepreneurs to be capable of thriving in their varied roles in the organization. <br>
 
 
<b><font style="color:green">Set a Role Model</font></b><br>
 
Choose leaders whom entrepreneurs idolize most. They may be leaders of modern world or may be legendary leaders from history or maybe both. Start working by combining styles that <br>
entrepreneurs think are most suitable for them. They might include personally known mentors as well. <br>
 
 
<b><font style="color:green">Maintain Discipline and Decorum</font></b><br>
 
To become an entrepreneur, you need to change some habits that you inherited when you were a follower. A good control over the working process and a consistent rate of implementing ideas are necessary qualities of an entrepreneur. As entrepreneurs, who we have seen before, basic building blocks of a great leader is based on being sincere; have some patience and wait to strike the right note. <br>
 
<b><font style="color:green">Be Determined</font></b><br>
 
Embrace responsibilities of entrepreneurs to understand the role of one. Be persistent in the role of an entrepreneur as it is one of the toughest things to do. <br>
 
 
<b><font style="color:green">Learn to Study</font></b><br>
 
Be a student of the qualities in a good leader. Conduct various researches with respect to subject, listen to records, lectures and debates about entrepreneurship and take classes based on it. There are many learning options available in the market. Study the greatest ideas out of each of them and start to implement them in everyday activities and thinking. <br>
 
 
<b><font style="color:green">Practice</font></b><br>
 
Know the basics of entrepreneurship and then try to master them, while integrating some newer attributes or consciousness level all time. With course of time, not only will entrepreneurs become the masters at the art of harnessing their skills, but also will become capable enough to mentor others towards becoming better leaders as well. <br>
 
This brings us to the statement that entrepreneurs are made, not born. The path of an entrepreneur will not necessarily always seem to be easy nor it may look fun, but they need to keep in mind that their goals are always within reach. Some people like to say that journey itself contains all the rewards. With this positive attitude, entrepreneurs are already nurturing their winning habits. <br>
 
 
<b><font style="color:green">Risk Takers</font></b><br>
 
If an entrepreneur intends to grow, it is important to sportively accept failures as different possibilities. A great entrepreneur has to do this and tell others they need not worry about failures. In fact, the best of entrepreneurs follow their idea at the cost of repeated failures, as every misstep gets them closer to success. <br>
 
Entrepreneurs must be willing to take certain risks, so that they learn from their mistakes and become capable enough to answer questions correctly to make investors feel comfortable with their idea. That is why if someone approaches an entrepreneur with an idea, they don’t<br>
 immediately reject it as ineffective.
They permit him/her to think around the idea and determine if it really makes sense. If something goes wrong, they do not discourage that person, instead they are grateful for learning something new. Entrepreneurs gain experience and learn from such meetings, which encourages them to take more risks by analyzing every aspect of that risk. <br>
 
 
 
<b><font style="color:green">Ethical Behavior</font></b><br>
 
Entrepreneurs set the bar very high when it comes to maintaining their integrity and accountability towards the organization, irrespective of any circumstances that may, at times, look detrimental to the company’s cause. Still, in the longer run, the organization will come out much stronger and better because of this. <br>
 
Entrepreneurs will be held liable for some of their toughest decisions. They need to keep in mind that it is never possible to satisfy everyone to their heart’s content all the time. But the least entrepreneurs can do is to be fair to all their team members. When the nature of business is a bit too competitive, entrepreneurs will have to take tough decisions, which may initially be unsavory, but will benefit the company later. <br>
 
 
<b><font style="color:green">Positive Attitude</font></b><br>
 
The significance of a positive attitude is great in the professional lives of entrepreneurs. Great entrepreneurs tend to harness a strong, positive attitude that leaves a mark on others and tends to spread throughout the team. They inject their team members’ minds with confidence, which makes them capable enough to bounce back in in case of any adverse circumstances. <br>
 
Even if entrepreneurs have a greater number of odds against them, greater also are the chances for a true entrepreneur to rise from a tough situation. As a matter of fact, a large number of entrepreneurs have earned fame for themselves by standing strongly against the toughest of times. <br>
 
 
People at times perceive them as being unshakable and calm during crisis situations. This does not mean that they are just acting likewise and are being untrue to themselves. A great leader, most of the times, needs help when something does not go right. However, the most important quality is not to panic and lose focus<br>
 
 
<b><font style="color:green">Eat that Gerbil</font></b><br>
 
Imagine one morning you wake up and you eat a Gerbil for breakfast. This may sound disgusting but the best part is nothing worse than this could happen to you all day. So, the entire day, you will have a satisfaction that nothing worse than this could happen<br>
.
Here, Gerbil is the work that has the greatest impact on achieving your goals and the work that you are most likely to procrastinate starting. There is a different story which says, "If you have to eat two gerbils, eat the ugliest one first!". Let us put it this way, say you have two important tasks to complete, then start with the biggest, toughest and the most important task first. <br>
 
 
Always discipline yourself to start immediately and then to stop when you complete that task. Do not let your mind wander in any other task. Always try to stop yourself from starting with the easier task. Remember, a small decision you take today affects your present and your future as well. <br>
 
 
Now, if you plan to eat a living Gerbil, it will not sit quiet waiting for you to come and eat it. You must work hard to catch it first; so, the key to complete your task is by learning how to handle different situations and planning what is the most important thing you have to complete, and then start working on it. <br>
 
<b><font style="color:red">ROLES/RESPONSIBILITIES  OF AN ENTREPRENEUR</font></b><br>
 
 
Entrepreneurs fulfill the following three dominant roles -<br>
 
• <b>Economic Change</b><br>
 
• <b>Social Change</b><br>
 
• <b>Technological Change</b><br>
 
These are referred to as behavioral roles. All entrepreneurs have these common characteristics and decide to become an entrepreneur due to the factors or circumstances in their lives which made them think the way they do. <br>
 
 
<h2><b><font style="color:light blue">BASIC MANAGERIAL ROLES.</h2></b></font><br>
To do their work effectively and operate a successful business, these entrepreneurs should perform certain roles. These roles are the same as the basic managerial roles. All such roles are listed out in detail as follows -<br>
<b><font style="color:green">Figure Head Role</b></font><br>
 
The entrepreneur needs to be the Head in the organization and participate in ceremonial duties, such as representing the organization in formal and informal events or even being the public spokesperson whenever there is a press release, etc<br>.
<b><font style="color:green">Leader Role</b></font><br>
 
The entrepreneur should also act as a leader because an entrepreneur may need to bring people with dissenting views and approaches to work together as a team. So, he needs to be good with his people management and leadership skills. He has to lead the people by hiring, firing, training and motivating his resources as and when necessary. <br>
<b><font style="color:green">Liaison Role</b></font><br>
 
The entrepreneur should also be the liaison officer for his organization. He should be the source of link with the outside world and business houses, always trying to find an opportunity of working together with other big organizations. <br>
<b><font style="color:green">Monitor Role</b></font><br>
 
The entrepreneur acts as a regulatory body too; he monitors both the internal and the external environment of the business constantly. <br>
<b><font style="color:green">Information Provider and Receiver Role</b></font><br>
 
The entrepreneur should also act as the organizational representative and transmit information internally and externally the organization. <br>
<b><font style="color:green">Spokesman Role</b></font><br>
 
The manager should also act as the spokesman of the business and transmit information internally and externally the organization. He needs to be the source of knowledge about his company to potential investors and collaborators. <br>
<b><font style="color:green">Entrepreneurial Role</b></font><br>
 
This is the basic role of the entrepreneur; he/she declares new ideas for the organizations, brainstorms it with the employees and friends and then bears the risk of any unsuccessful implementation. <br><br>
<b><font style="color:green">Disturbance Handler</b></font><br>
 
The entrepreneur needs to act as the mediator and bring people with dissenting thoughts to the table and get them motivated to work together. He needs to handle all conflicts and get the team to focus constantly on the goal. <br>
<b><font style="color:green">Resource Allocator</b></font><br>
 
The entrepreneur needs to find out how the available resources can be allocated between different departments of the organization to suit their demands and necessities. This helps them achieve the organizational goals and the objectives. <br>
<b><font style="color:green">Negotiator Role</b></font><br>
The entrepreneur must negotiate on behalf of the organization both internally with the staff as well as with the external investors or collaborators. At such opportunities, the entrepreneurs need to be more focused on their role of being a ‘win-win” deal breaker. <br>
<h3><b><font style="color:light blue">Added Roles of an Entrepreneur.</h2></b></font><br>
<br>
Apart from the above-mentioned roles, there are some specific entrepreneurial roles that a person is supposed to fill up in his duties of an entrepreneur. These are divided into three categories, which are as follows -<br>
1.  Social Roles, <br>
2.  Economic Roles, and<br>
3.  Technological Roles. <br>
Let us now discuss each of them in detail. <br>

<b><font style="color:blue">CHAPTER TWO : SMALL BUSINESSES</b></font></h2><br>
<br>
Small business is a business which is independently owned and operated, not dominated in its field of operation and meets certain standard of number of employee and capital. <br>
 In general there are two approaches to define a small business; measures of the size and economic/ control criteria<br>
Size criteria<br>
Some of the criteria’s to measure the size are<br>
• Number of employees: - for example in Ethiopian case it is
• Less than 30 employees (6-30). <br>
• Investment paid up capital: - for Ethiopia it is 100,001-
• 1,500,000 (industry), and 50,001-500,000 birr (service). <br>
• Volume of sales, production and deposits are also used to
measure the size of business<br>
?If there is ambiguity in the definition between the usage of<br>
man power and capital, it is recommended to use the total<br>
